Normalized linear combination:

$(X_{1}), (X_{2}), . . . , (X_{p})$

<br> $$  Z_1 = \phi_{11}X_1 +\phi_{21}X_2 +...+\phi_{p1}X_p $$ <br>

$\sum_{j=1}^p\phi_{j1}^2 = 1$

First principal component:

$(\phi_{11}, . . . , \phi_{p1})$

$\phi_1= (\phi_{11} \phi_{21} ... \phi_{p1})^T$

\`\`\`{Answer:} \## PCA is a dimensionality reduction technique that transforms high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional space. On the other hand, clustering is a method for grouping similar data points together based on their characteristics.
